CUDPP Change Log

Release: 1.1
1 July 2009
- Switched to pure BSD license.
- Added new radix sort implementation under cudppSort() (based on Satish et al. IPDPS '09 paper).  All previous sorts have been removed.
- Added cudppRand() pseudorandom number generation (based on Tzeng and Wei I3D 08 paper).
- Added support for backward segmented scan.
- Fixed satGL example to run in a native window on OS X, rather than an X11 window.
- Removed Visual Studio 7.1 (2003) project files.  CUDA 2.1 and later dropped support for VS7.1.
- Miscellaneous bug fixes.
- In docs, Added list of publications that use CUDPP, including both text and bibtex citation format.
- In docs, Updated list of publications of algorithms includedin CUDPP.
- Miscellaneous Documentation improvements.

Release: 1.0 alpha
20 April 2008
- Implemented new public interface based on plan objects
- Changed the interface for cudppCompact so that it takes a user-defined isValid flags array rather than 
  computing it based on the values in the input array.
- Fixed various bugs in cudppCompact, and made backwards compact (aka reverse-and-compact) work correctly.
- Fixed emudebug memory fault with global radix sorts of non-block-aligned sizes (change was in setFlagBit)
- Added segmented scan - works with add, multiply, min, max operators
- Added support for inclusive scans and segmented scans
- Scan now supports operators add, multiply, min, and max
- Replaced tree-based "Blelloch" scan algorithm with new "warp scan" algorithm.  About 10% faster on 
  current GPUs and far simpler code (no need for bank conflict avoidance code, hacky #defines in inner loop,
  etc.).
- Added typename keyword in front of "TypeToVector::Result" so that CUDPP compiles with CUDA 2.0.

Release: cudpp_gems3-2
19 November 2007
- Fixed performance regression in cudppScan introduced by CUDA 1.1.  Improves performance of scan in CUDA 1.1 by up to 16%.
- Scans with MAX operator now function correctly for signed floats (float MAX identity is now -FLT_MAX, was FLT_MIN)
- Added a 64-bit (windows XP) configuration to cudpp.vcproj (64-bit windows currently only minimally tested)
- Changed Makefile to add "64" to the libcudpp names in 64-bit linux.
- Added changelog

Release: cudpp_gems3-1
5 November 2007
- Initial CUDPP public beta release
